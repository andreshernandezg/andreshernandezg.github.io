## Andres Hernandez Gutierrez

Andres obtained his PhD in Robotics at the [Australia Centre for Field Robotics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/our-research/robotics-and-intelligent-systems/australian-centre-for-field-robotics.html), which is part of the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/) in Australia, in 2013. He graduated from his MEng and BEng from the Universidad de Guanajuato, México, in 2006 and 2003, respectively. His reseach interests include robotic perception, computer vision, machine learning and deep learning models, as well as automonous systems and multimodal sensor data fusion applied to precision agriculture, environmental monitoring and precision livestock farming.

Currently, Andres is an assistant professor within the School of Engineering and Technologies at the [Universidad de Monterrey](https://www.udem.edu.mx/es), México. He leads the Agricultural Robotics and Autonomous Systems (ARAS) research group, as well as the Robotics Club and conducts applied research for the agriculture industry and lectures artificial intelligence and robotics.
